# PiGS : COLMAP-free Gaussian Splatting Using Prior Gaussians
This personal project is implemented for the Research Project 1 (CSED499I-01) course at POSTECH.
#### PiGS is a model that performs Gaussian Splatting without requiring any prior information except the RGB image set for the scene.
This is based on [InstantSplat](https://github.com/NVlabs/InstantSplat) and aims to overcome its limitation where the training time increases by O(n^2) as the number of input images grows, despite InstantSplat offering fast training speeds.
